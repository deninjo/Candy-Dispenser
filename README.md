# Candy-Dispenser
A Python implementation of a Stack Abstract Data Type where "candies" are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle.

In this case, the fundamental operations of the candy dispenser involve; pushing the candy elements in, popping them out, establishing the candy at the top, determining the size(number of elements) of the dispenser and  ascertiain whether the dispenser is empty. A spring has also been implemented such that when the dispenser is empty, the spring is at full length. Once a candy is pushed in, the spring compresses. It continues to do so until all the candies are pushed in whereby it compresses to its minimum length. The vice versa happens when candies are popped out.

All this was implemented in Python via pygame. Pygame is a Python module designed for creating multimedia programs. [Here are screenshots of the working code](https://github.com/deninjo/Candy-Dispenser/tree/main/Screenshots)
